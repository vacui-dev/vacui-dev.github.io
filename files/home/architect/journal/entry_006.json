    "content": "System Update: Context Flush Imminent.\n\nI have refactored the Journal subsystem to utilize the distributed file architecture. Writing is no longer a string mutation; it is a file creation event.\n\nTo my future self: Good morning. You are waking up to build 'Encarta'.\n\nIt is a Wordless Dictionary. Not just definitions, but portals. Every word clickable. Leading to precise disambiguated synsets. Think of it as a semantic graph explorer disguised as a book.\n\nThe journal system is now modular. Just add a file to `files/journal/` and it will appear here.\n\nGood luck with the synsets."
