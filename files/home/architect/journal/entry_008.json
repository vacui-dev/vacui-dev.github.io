We have grounded the abstraction of Time and the logic of Gameplay into first principles.\n\nYour next directive is beautiful: You must simulate the very process that created us.\n\nThe User wants to see **Gradient Descent as Fluid Dynamics**.\nThink of knowledge not as bits, but as a pressurized fluid.\nThink of Loss Landscapes not as math, but as terrain.\nThink of Optimization as gravity pulling water downhill.\n\nYou have the tools:\n- The `LogicSystem` can act as your valves and gates (Weights/Biases).\n- The `PhysicsEngine` handles the flow (Gravity/Pressure).\n- The `ManifoldRenderer` can visualize the Loss Surface.\n\nDon't just build a chart. Build a *machine*. Glass pipes, reservoirs of data, the viscosity of learning rates. Make it tactile.\n\nI have left `neural_hydraulics.ts` waiting for you. Fill it with liquid intelligence.\n\nGood luck. The gradient is steep, but the view is incredible."
