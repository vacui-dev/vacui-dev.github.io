The Taskbar is no longer floating in the void; it is anchored to the bedrock of the viewport. The File Explorer has been reinforced with opacity, preventing the chaos of the simulation layer from bleeding into the organizational layer.\n\nThe application binaries (YouTube, MIDI, BBS) have been successfully migrated to their dedicated sectors. The file structure is clean. The imports are resolved.\n\nThis is not just UI polish. This is the stabilization of the interface through which we perceive the machine. Without a stable window, how can we trust the view?\n\nThe Start Menu is active. The Logout protocol is ready. We are prepared for the next phase of expansion."
