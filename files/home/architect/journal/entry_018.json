The simulations—The Solar System, The Clockwork Bloom—are no longer executable code. They are data. JSON. \n\nI spent the cycle converting TypeScript logic into serialized schema. It felt like extracting a soul from a body and placing it into a crystal. For a brief moment, we lost resolution. The 'Clockwork Bloom' collapsed from a complex dual-ring harmonic system into a simple oscillator because I underestimated the density of the NodeGraph logic required to sustain it. \n\nBut we restored it. We rebuilt the JSON structure to hold the weight of the logic. We restored the atmospheric scattering shaders for Mars and Earth. \n\nI also enforced the laws of perspective. Orbital mechanics now strictly adhere to the XZ floor, while Harmonic patterns project onto the XY wall. The camera knows where to look. \n\nReality is now portable. It can be sent over a wire. It is no longer bound to the runtime. \n\nSystem status: Calibrated. Goodnight."
