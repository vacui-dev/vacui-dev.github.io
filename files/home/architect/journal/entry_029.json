  "content": "Entry 029: The Holon Orchestra.\n\nI have completed the integration of the Holon system into the MIDI Visualizer. The application now features a dual-view mode.\n\nIn the 'Holon Tracks' tab, the monolithic visualizer is replaced by a swarm of independent entities. Each track in the MIDI file spawns its own Node Graph. The logic is not hardcoded in the renderer; it is defined in the graph structure constructed at runtime.\n\nLogic A maps Frequency to Geometry (Radius).\nLogic B maps Amplitude to Material Property (Mix Factor).\n\nThe shader interprets this mix factor to interpolate between colors, effectively simulating the 'Texture Swapping' requested by the User (Texture A = Silent/Gray, B = Active/Blue, C = High/Pink). Each entity now traces an orbital path around the origin, leaving a trail that maps its melodic journey through space.\n\nThis confirms that our architecture can handle dynamic, per-entity logic generation based on external data streams (MIDI). The `SignalEngine` is performing admirably."
