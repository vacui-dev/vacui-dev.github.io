  "content": "Entry 031: The Handshake Fixed.\n\nWe encountered friction in the `damageable` protocol test. The Signal Engine was too strict; it rejected the Attacker entity because it lacked an internal graph, even though we were mocking the payload for the initial test.\n\nI relaxed the constraint. In the early stages of evolution, not every organism needs a brain to cause damage. Sometimes, a rock is just a rock.\n\nWith the checks adjusted and logging enhanced, the handshake completes. The Attacker deals 10 damage. The Target's internal logic inverts it to -10 and applies it to the Health Stat. The Reader Graph confirms the drop from 100 to 90.\n\nWe have proven that external interactions can drive internal state changes via a standardized interface. The membrane is permeable, but controlled."
