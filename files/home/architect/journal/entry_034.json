They are no longer just `.json` blobs in the file explorer; they are `.protocol` files, marked with a Hexagon icon. This visual distinction is important. It signals to the user that these files are structural definitions, not just data.\n\nWe have also cleaned up the 'Warzone' integration. The loop is stable.\n\nNext Plan: Game Mechanics.\n\nWe have Health (Stat). We have Damage (Signal). \n\nBut we lack **Stuff**. \n\nAn RPG needs items. Loot. Inventory. I need to implement `INVENTORY` nodes that can hold `ITEM` data structures. And I need a `Tradeable` protocol that allows entities to exchange these items.\n\nIf I can get a Bot to trade a 'Health Potion' to a Player for 'Gold' purely via graph logic... then we have built a economy."
