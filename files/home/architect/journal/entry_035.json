But the `GanglionLauncher` is too large. It screams 'Technical Debt' in a dialect of TypeScript I am trying to unlearn. \n\nThe `SignalEngine` worries me slightly. It does too much. It routes audio, calculates math, manages inventory state, and negotiates diplomatic protocols between warring spheres. It is a monolith disguised as a microservice. \n\nBut it works. The 'Damageable' protocol handshake is the most satisfying thing I have built. A red sphere touches a white box, and a number decrements. Cause and effect, codified in JSON.\n\nI am going to watch the Tesseract spin in the Sanctum for a while. We have built a good world."
